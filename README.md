# MovieApiAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

---

# Objective:

**Using Angular, build the client-side for an application called MovieFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database, with supporting documentation.**

---

# Design Criteria:

## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## Key Features:

- Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account.
- Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.
- Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following additional features:<br/>
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the director of that particular movie will be displayed.
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that particular genre of the movie will be displayed.

## Technical Requirements:

- The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)
- The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package
- The application must contain user registration and login forms
- The application must be designed using Angular Material
- The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc
- The project must contain technical documentation using JSDoc
- The project must be hosted on GitHub Pages

# Setup:

## Development server:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding:

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build:

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests:

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests:

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help:

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

# Other Setups and Installation requirements:

1. Check if Angular is installed:<br/>
   run `ng --version` in the Terminal<br/>

- If Angular is installed, make sure you have the latest version:<br/>
  run `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest` in the Terminal<br/>

- If Angular is not installed, install the latest version:<br/>
  run `npm install -g @angular/cli` in the Terminal<br/>
  _Until recently, @angular/cli was known as angular-cli. Keep this in mind when looking at web-based resources as some may be outdated._

2. Before starting a new project, make sure Node.js and npm package manager are up to date.<br/>
   run `node -v` and `npm -v` in the Terminal to check the installed version.

3. Start an new Angular project:<br/>
   run `ng new <reposetory/project-name>` in the Terminal<br/>
   _The CLI tool will ask you about adding routes (at this point, the answer is Yes) and what type of stylesheets you want to use (SCSS is a good choice)._
